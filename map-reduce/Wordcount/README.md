### Map/Reduce - wordcount with streaming, using Python code.

Running wordcount_mapper.py and wordcount_reducer.py on testfile1 and testfile2

- with default numReduceTasks, result in wordcount_num_default_output.txt
- with numReduceTasks=0 (no reducers), result in wordcount_num0_output.txt, we can see that words and counts are not accumulated.
